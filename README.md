# Election Audit Analysis 
##  Overview
We were hired to support Colorado Boards of Elections in the election of the Congressional precint in Colorado. The results must be the total number of votes, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes of each candidate and the winner of the electoosn. Also  must present additional data to complete the audit:
the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, the county with the highest turnout.
The Client wants the Election results printed to the Comanda Line and Saved to a Text File. 
## Election Audit Results  
We decided to do a Python program in order to have a general .....  The total votes are stored in a *.cvs file in the format: ID Ballot, County, Candidate voted.

Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?  
   There was a total 369,711 votes.
    Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
2. Which county had the largest  of votes? Dever was the county with 306,055 votes
    Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
3. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
    The Winner of the election was candidate Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes, 73.8% from the total votes.
    
## Election-Audit Summary: 
We can conclude that the program made for this problem can also be used for any vote count regardless of the position, since it only requires that the votes be stored in the same way as in this problem. As the program does not specify the position that is being chosen, we could ask the user to specify in a capture the position that is being chosen in order to identify it as the header of our results report.
Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
